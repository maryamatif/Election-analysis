# ANALYSIS OF ELECTION AUDIT FOR THE ELECTION COMMISSION
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this exercise was to analyze the voting information and understand the statistics regarding the winning candidate, winning county and winning number of votes. Using an elaborative code, we were able to synthesize a large amount of data efficiently. This can be shared with the election commission to better understand the dynaimcs of the counties in question. 

## Results
### 1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
The total number of votes casted were 369,711 in the congressional election.

### 2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
We analyzed 3 counties: Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe.
Jefferson received 38,855 votes which constituted 10.5% of the total votes.
Denver received 306,055 votes which constituted 82.8% of the total votes.
Arapahoe received 24,801 votes which constituted 6.7% of the total votes.

### 3. Which county had the largest number of votes?

## Election-Audit Summary: 
The script used to analyze the results can be used for any state ,city, country in general or any other kind of eleciton (ex. federal vs. state). Tweaking the names of the counties in question, we can use the code to understand the election results of any area. 
We can also add other information to the script like male/female voter turnout or which election centers within each counties received the most votes. Adding simple codes to our script can help us analyze a much larger set of data.
